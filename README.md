The **Shared Resource Form Generator** is a more streamlined, easy to access method to submit information and generate multiple orders for sequencing services. There are two main options on the form, the *Hartwell Center services* and *CAB (Center of Applied Bioinformatics)* services, from which you can choose the sequencing service you are interested in. After you have entered in all of your sample submissions, you may download your order onto an Excel spreadsheet. 

In addition, you will also find two new buttons! We have created an **SRM Quicktool**, which will help you quickly and efficiently create a form to submit to SRM for your direct needs. However, in the case you are confused as to where you should order your sequencing to, or if you need assistance in the project you are conducting, we have also installed an **SRM Consult Form**. The SRM Consult Form will allow you to request the assistance of a staff member who can best answer your sequencing questions pertaining to your project.
